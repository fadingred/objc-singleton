 \brief		Performs a method swizzle

 			This is a little different from traditional method swizzling, but the concept is the same. The
			original method will be replaced by a new method, and you can have the old implementation stored
			in an IMP pointer for use in the swizzled method. This works out to be a little safer than method
			swizzling since the _cmd argument can be passed through to the original IMP unaltered.
